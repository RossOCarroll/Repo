/*
You volunteered to help out teaching a preschool in your area! You were given an array of all students and 
some important data about them, grouped by their teacher. Create a function that will ungroup every student 
so you can look at their details individually.

Input: A array of nested objects
Output: A an array of objects with the sutdents ungrouped from the teacher

Rules:
  - Take the input array where students are grouped by teacher and return an array where students
    have their own object with teacher, name and other info
  - 

Questions:
  - Will there always be a array input?
  - Will an empoty array be input?
  -

Data structure:
  - Array with nested objects

Algorithm:
  - Create a result array
  - Create a student object
