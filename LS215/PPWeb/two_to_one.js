/*
Take two objects with similar key values and combine them into a new object summing any values that belong to 
the same category.

There's a married couple, Hank and his spouse Sheila. Hank works at a power plant making $70,000 a year, and 
Sheila is a teacher making $40,000 a year. They both earn rental income from separate rental properties, 
Hank will get $12,000 and Sheila $10,000. The new object will show their separate income but combine the 
rental income because it fits the same category.

Input:
  - 2 objects keys and values as numbers
Output:
  - One object combining the numbers of the same keys

Requirements:
  - The input objects wont have the same number of key value pairs
  - If the key is the same combine sum the two values

Questions:
  - Will there be any empty obejects input?
  - Will we always recieve two arguments? one? none?

data Structure:
  - I want to creat a object to combine both objects

Algorithm:
  - Declare a combined object
  - Iterate over both input objects
    - If the keys are equal
      - add the value 1 + value2 to the combined object
    - else
      - add user 1 key, value
      - add user2 key, value
  - order the combined object by values
  - Return combined
