From Ulysses:
“Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his 
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he 
used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness 
to make himself interesting to that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought 
he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for 
herself and her soul greatest miser ever.” This sentence showcases Joyce's 
stream-of-consciousness style, where thoughts and narrative intertwine 
seamlessly.
