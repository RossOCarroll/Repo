```sql
CREATE TABLE things (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  item text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  material text NOT NULL
);
```

The above uses DDL Data Definition Language. We are using CREATE TABLE to create or define a table called things. We are then defining an id column that is the primary key. A item column that hold text that is also not null and is unique. Also a material column that holds text and is not null.
