```ruby
def some_method
  a = 1
  5.times do
    puts a
    b = 2
  end

  puts a
  puts b
end

some_method
```

This code will output the integer `1` 6 times and return `nil`. It will also raise an error for undefined local variable or method.

`Line 13` The method `some_method` is invoked.

`line 2` We see the method defintion for `some_method` on `lines 2 - 11`. `line 3` local variable `a` initialized and assgned to the integer `1`. `line 4` the `times` method is invoked on the integer `5` and a `do...end` block is passed as an argument. `line 5` the `puts` is called on the variable `a`. `line 6` the local variable `b` is initialized and assigned to the integer `2`.

We get this error beacuse of rubys local variable scoping rules. On `line 10` when the `puts` method is called on the local variable `b` it is in the outer scope. We are not able to access variables initialized in the inner scope where `b` was intialized.
