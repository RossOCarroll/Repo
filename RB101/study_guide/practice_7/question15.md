```ruby
MY_TEAM = "Los Angeles Clippers"

loop do
  MY_TEAM = "Phoenix Suns"
  break
end

while true
  MY_TEAM = "Los Angeles Lakers"
  break
end

def best_team
  MY_TEAM = "Utah Jazz"
end

puts MY_TEAM
```

`Line 2` the constant variable `MY_TEAM` is initialized and assigned to the string object `"Los angeles lakers"`.

`line 4` the `loop` method is invoked and a `do..end` block is passed in as an argument. `line 5` the `MY_TEAM` constant is reassigned to the string object `"Phoenix Suns"`.

This code will raise an error for dynamic constant assignment. As we cannot initialize a constant variable in a method defintion.
