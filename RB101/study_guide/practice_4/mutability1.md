```ruby
def fix(value)
  value = value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

This code will outputs `"HELLO"` `"HELLO"` and return the same.

On `line 7` the local variable `s` is inialized and assigned to the string object `'hello'`. On `line 8` the local variable `t` is assigned to the return value of the `fix` method with the variable `s` as an argument.

On `line 2` through `line 5` the method definition for `fix` thats givin the parameter `value`. `line 3` we have the reassignment of the variable `value` to the `upcase!` method called on `value`. `line 4` the `concat` method is also called on `value` with `!` as an argument.

This code demonstrates rubys rules of object mutability. Both `upcase!` and `concat` method are destructive meaning they will permenantly alter the object `s`. The `fix` method is a mutating method.
