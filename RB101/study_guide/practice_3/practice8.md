```ruby
def fix(value)
 value[1] = 'x'
 value 
end

s = 'abc'
t = fix(s)
```

`line 7` local variable `s` is initiated and asigned the string object `abc`. `line 8` we have local variable `t` assigned to the return value of the `fix` method with `s` passed to it as an argument. 

on `line 2` is the `fix` method deffinition that takes one parameter `value`. Within that method definition on `line 3` we have the `setter` method called with an argument `[1]` and iassignin the 1 index to the object `x`. This will replace the 1 index in the `s` string to `x`. 

The `fix` method called on `s` will return `"axc"` and it will also mutate the orginial objext `s` so now `t` and `s` values are `"axc"`. This shows rubys concepts in object mutability. In this calse ruby is acting as a pass by reference language.
