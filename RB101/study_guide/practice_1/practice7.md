```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
```
On line 2 we have the each method called on the array [1, 2, 3]. Then a block is intiated as an argument to the .each method. Within that block a |num| varible is intiated. On line 3 we have the puts method called on the |num| varible. The each method will iterate through each element in the array and output that and output the integer 1 2 and 3. The puts method will out these on all new lines and return nil on all three elements.
