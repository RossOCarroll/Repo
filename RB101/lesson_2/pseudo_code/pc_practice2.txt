1# A method that takes the sum of two integers

- prompt user for two integers
- get input from user and validate that the input is an integer. if so, assign input to a varilable Else return error
- add the two integers and assign them to a variable
- print the variable

START

GET input from user
Validate input == integer
SET Number1 = input

GET input 2 from user
Vallidate input == integer
SET number2 = input

SET sum = number1 + number2
PRINT sum

2# A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those string concatenated together

Given an array of strings

Create an empty string and assign to a variable
create a method that iterates through the array of strings one by one
  - For each iteration, append each element of the array collection to the string variable

Return the string

START

SET output_string

GET array_of_strings
  ITERATE each input_string
  SET to output_string
PRINT output string

3# a method that take an array of integers, and returns a new array with with 
every other element from the original array, starting with the first element 

GIVEN an array of integers 

Create a new array called even_integers

Iterate through the given array
  -append the value of the elements at space 0 and even spaces to even_integers


START

Given an array of integers

Set result = array
SET counter +1
While counter < array size
  iterate over the array elements
  add to the result first element and skip following

Return result

3# a method that determines the index of the occurrence 
of a given character in a shring

GET array
SET Index = +1
IF array[] = odd?
  add to new_array
Else  
  next
Break when array index = 0
end

#4

GET string

Counter = 0
String Split
occurance = String each
If occurance == x
  counter = 1
  next
Else
  Counter = 3
Break
end

#5

Get array1
Get array2
