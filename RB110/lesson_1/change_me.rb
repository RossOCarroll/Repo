# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method change_me which returns the same
# string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

# change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# change_me("") == ""
# change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"

# Input:
#   -String

# Output:
#   -String but with all palendromes in upper case

# Implicit reqirments:
#   -Empty strings should return empty strings
#   -Upper case elements should remain uppercased in return string.

# Explicit requirments:
#   -Palindromes are case sensitive

# Questions:
#     -Returning the same string? return a new string

# Test Cases / Exsamples:

# # change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# # change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# # change_me("") == ""
# # change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"
