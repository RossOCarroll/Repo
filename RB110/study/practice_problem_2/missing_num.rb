There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.


Input:
  -An array of numbers

Output:
  -the number that is not equal to the rest of the numbers
  
Rules
  Explicit:
    -input array will be at least 3 numbers
